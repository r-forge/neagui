\title{Network Enrichment Analysis
}
\description{
nea performs network enrichment analysis.
The number of network links between a novel altered gene set (AGS) and a known functional gene set (FGS) is computed and 
assessed by the number of network links obtained from randomly permuted network where the degree distribution is kept. 
As a measure of activation of the FGS, we provide the z-score. 

manypnet generates a specified number of randomly permuted networks. 
}
\usage{
nea(ags, fgs, fgslib = NULL, network, pnet = NULL, nperm = 50, stat="F", seed = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
\item{ags}{
A vector of altered genes. Gene symbols (upper case) are used as a default.
}
  \item{fgs}{
A list defined by user or a character to specify GO ontologies or KEGG pathway. 
User can provide their own functional 
gene sets as a list. 
Options to specify GO ontologies or KEGG pathway are
"CC","BP","MF" and "KEGG" (cellular component, biological process, moelcular function and KEGG pathway). 
}
  \item{fgslib}{
A character of the name of annotation data.
To use GO terms or KEGG pathways, a specific annotation data should be specified. 
}
  \item{network}{
A vector of gene pairs 
or a list representing the network link. 
For the vector case, each element has
a combined name of two gene symbols with separation ''. For example, 
"7SK ALDOA". The number of network links
is computed with respect to this network.
}
  \item{pnet}{
A list of randomly permuted networks. 
This is the output of manypnet. If you do not specify this,
the permutation procedure for the network automatically performed. 
}
  \item{nperm}{
The number of permutations
}
  \item{stat}{
Two types of network enrichment statistic: FNEA and MNEA. 
FNEA (stat="F") depends on the size of ags while MNEA (Stat="M") avoids the dependence by taking
the largest statistic across AGS. Default is FNEA.
}
  \item{seed}{
A seed number for the permutation procedure
}

 \item{nlink}{A vector (of length of fgs) of numbers (stat="F") or a matrix (length of fgs by length of ags lying in the given network) of numbers (stat="M"). The numbers are the network links between AGS and FGS under the given network.}
 \item{res.nlink}{A matrix (the length of fgs by the number of permutation) of network link numbers obtained from the randomly permuted networks (stat="F") or a list of matrix consisting of network link numbers obtained from the randomly permuted networks (stat="M"). When stat="M", each matrix has the same size as nlink and the length of the list is the same as the number of permutation.}
 \item{zscore}{A vector (of length of fgs) of numbers to assess the activation of FGS (stat="F").}
 \item{zscore.mat}{A matrix (the length of fgs by the number of permutation+1) of numbers to assess the activation of FGS (stat="M"). The first nperm columns are from the randomly permuted networks and the last column is from observed data.}
